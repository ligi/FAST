        <H1>Answers</H1>Just type in a fraction from the name of the app you want to launch in the top. Click the app to
        start or long click the app for more options. If you have a phone with Android Jelly Bean (or newer), you can also use the Google Now gesture
        to start this app. To find out how much faster you got with this app you could try <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ligi.launchometer&referrer=utm_source%3Dfast%26utm_medium%3Dplay">Applaunch-O-Meter</a> which is also available for free.
